I have successfully coded, setup, and tested the following configurations and services in my NixOs operating system with the examples provided in my repository:

## Syncing User Home Folder to a Specified Destination

One of the key scripts I've developed is a custom synchronization script. This script allows me to effortlessly sync my user home folder to a specified destination. By running this script, I can ensure that all my important files and configurations are backed up and accessible from any location. This is particularly helpful when I switch machines or need to restore my settings after a fresh installation.

To streamline my workflow, I've also developed a set of personal scripts that assist me with mounting, unmounting, and suspending operations. These scripts automate common tasks, saving me time and effort in managing external drives or suspending my system when I step away. By executing these scripts, I can perform these operations with just a single command, making my workflow more efficient.

## Custom NixOS Configuration File with Bluetooth Variables

As an enthusiast of NixOS, a powerful Linux distribution with a declarative approach to system configuration, I've created a custom configuration file tailored to my needs. In this file, I've set specific variables related to Bluetooth devices. By configuring these variables, I can easily manage my Bluetooth devices and ensure a seamless experience.

## Calling Common NixOS Commands with a Custom Script

To further simplify my interactions with NixOS, I've developed a custom script that encapsulates the most frequently used commands. With this script, I can quickly execute common tasks such as updating the system, installing packages, or configuring services. This saves me the hassle of remembering or typing out lengthy commands each time I need to perform these operations.

![1](https://github.com/tolgaerok/Linux-Tweaks-And-Scripts/assets/110285959/ae14cea8-dae9-4ea9-842d-7232e62ca9ff)

## Conclusion

In this blog post, I've highlighted some of the key components of my GitHub environment. From syncing my user home folder to developing scripts for mounting, unmounting, and suspending, to customizing my NixOS configuration file with Bluetooth variables and creating a script for common NixOS commands, these tools greatly enhance my productivity and simplify my workflow.

If you're interested in exploring these scripts or incorporating them into your own environment, feel free to check out my GitHub repository. I hope you find them useful and they inspire you to create your own custom solutions to enhance your development experience!

Happy coding! 😄

## *`How to run?`*

1. Make sure `git` is usable. If not, *add it into your environment.systemPackages in configuration.nix:*
   - Execute `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` in your terminal afterward.

```sh
Terminal: nix-shell -p git
Terminal: nix-shell -p git-extras
Terminal: nix-shell -p gitFull

or add into your configuration.nix file

# Nix package collection (pkgs) that you want to include in the system environment.
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [    
    git
    git-extras
];

```

2. Open Terminal, type:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tolgaerok/nixos.git
cd ./nixos
```

3. Copy either or all files into your /etc/nixos directory:
   - *configuration.nix*
   - *hardware-configuration.nix*  - Change to suit to you `UUID`
   - *bluetooth.service*
   - *smb-secrets*
    
Execute `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` in your terminal afterward.

```sh
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```
