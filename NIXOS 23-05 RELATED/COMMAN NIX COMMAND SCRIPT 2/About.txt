This script is a menu-driven tool that allows the user to run common Nix commands with sudo privileges. It provides a list of commands related to Nix package management and system configuration and executes the selected command using the sudo command. Here is a summary of its functionality:

    The script defines several functions, including execute_command to run a command in sudo mode, display_menu to show the menu options, and delete_old_generations to delete old generations of the active profile.

    The display_menu function displays a list of Nix commands along with their descriptions.

    The script clears the screen and displays the initial menu.

    It enters a loop that waits for the user to input a choice.

    Depending on the selected choice, the script executes the corresponding command using the execute_command function with the appropriate arguments.

    After executing the command, the script prompts the user to press any key to continue.

    The screen is cleared, and the menu is displayed again for the user to choose another command or exit the script.

    The loop continues until the user selects the "Exit" option.

Overall, this script provides a convenient way to run commonly used Nix commands with sudo privileges in a menu-driven manner.
